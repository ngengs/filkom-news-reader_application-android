Great that you are thinking about submitting a PullRequest. Please keep them small if not otherwise possible, that mean if you make 2 change type of commit in example 1 bug fixing and 1 enhancement make that 2 separated pull request. Also try to add tests - I am not religious about that but prefer PRs backed by tests. This project has everything setup for Espresso UI and Unit-tests. Also the existing unit and UI-tests muss pass before submitting a PullRequest. Please base the PullRequests on development branch.
